# project battler
for cs50 final project creating a web application for playing multiplayer and recording the score between friends with a scope to add more games easily 
on the same web app. The choices of games are a simple game of stone paper scissors and a simple game of cricket know as oddeve.

## why such a multiplayer
as gaming solo can be boring and playing with a friend always adds a challenge and thrill to a game no matter what type of a game it is. the time we spend with 
friends makes and enriches the games expeirence and not always the game itself which make it enjoyble. and the feature keeping score of each encounter can add a challenge and a feeling of competitiveness. 

## how it works
it use sql database to manage all its data and code script changes path for eaach user its a simple multiplayer game with currently no option to play with a bot
or ai.
the rules of game and how to play are on the website
